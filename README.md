# ATM
 
This Python code is a GUI program for ATM banking system built using the Tkinter library. It allows users to create an account and log in using their credentials. Users can then perform basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
The program stores account data in a JSON file and reads from and writes to it when performing banking operations. The deposit and withdrawal functions check for negative and zero values and update the balance accordingly, applying a 0.5% fee.
The program includes validation checks for empty input fields, duplicate account creation, and valid login credentials. It also generates a random account number and ensures that the account number is unique.
The user interface includes a login screen, a home screen with deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry options, an input amount screen for deposit and withdrawal operations, and a back button to return to the home screen.
